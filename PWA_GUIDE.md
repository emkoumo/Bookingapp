## 🎨 Customizing App Icons

### Current Icons:
- Blue gradient background (#3b82f6 → #1e40af)
- White calendar with checkmark
- 192x192px and 512x512px sizes

### To Replace Icons:

**Option 1: Use a Design Tool**
1. Create 512x512px PNG icon in Figma/Photoshop
2. Export as `icon-512.png`
3. Resize to 192x192px → save as `icon-192.png`
4. Place both in `/public/` folder
5. Rebuild: `npm run build`

**Option 2: Edit SVG Source**
1. Edit `/public/icon.svg`
2. Run: `npx sharp-cli -i icon.svg -o icon-512.png resize 512 512`
3. Run: `npx sharp-cli -i icon.svg -o icon-192.png resize 192 192`

**Recommended Specs:**
- Format: PNG (not JPEG)
- Background: NOT transparent (fill with color)
- Content: Simple, clear at small sizes
- Safe zone: Keep important content in center 80%

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Vercel Deployment:
- ✅ Service worker auto-generated during build
- ✅ Cached at edge for fast delivery
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default (required for PWA)
- ✅ No additional configuration needed

### Testing PWA Features:

**Before Deployment (Local):**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Service worker WILL work on localhost
```

**After Deployment (Production):**
```bash
# Open deployed URL in mobile browser
# Check for install prompt
# Test offline mode (airplane mode)
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" doesn't appear:

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Using HTTPS (required - Vercel provides this)
- [ ] manifest.json accessible at /manifest.json
- [ ] Icons exist: /icon-192.png and /icon-512.png
- [ ] Service worker registered (check DevTools → Application)
- [ ] Visited site at least once

**Check in Chrome DevTools:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Check "Manifest" - should show all fields
4. Check "Service Workers" - should show registered worker

### App doesn't work offline:

**Reasons:**
- Service worker only works in production build
- Database operations always need internet
- Only core pages are cached
- Newly added pages need to be visited once to cache

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Add new pages to cache in next.config.ts
cacheOnFrontEndNav: true,
```

### Icons don't show:

**Check:**
1. Files exist: `/public/icon-192.png` and `/public/icon-512.png`
2. File sizes: 192x192px and 512x512px
3. Format: PNG (not SVG)
4. Rebuild after adding icons

## 📈 PWA Metrics

### Lighthouse PWA Audit:
After deployment, check PWA score:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App"
4. Click "Generate report"

**Target Score:** 100/100

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Installable
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Optimized for mobile
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ Engaging

## 🔄 Update Strategy

### When you deploy updates:
1. User opens installed PWA
2. Service worker checks for updates
3. Downloads new version in background
4. Shows update prompt (optional)
5. Updates on next app restart

### Force immediate update:
```javascript
// In next.config.ts
skipWaiting: true  // ✅ Already enabled
```

This means users get updates immediately without prompts.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Keep icons simple and clear
✅ Use solid background colors (not transparent)
✅ Test on real devices before launch
✅ Check PWA audit score regularly
✅ Monitor service worker errors

### DON'T:
❌ Use transparent icon backgrounds
❌ Make icons too detailed (hard to see when small)
❌ Forget to test offline functionality
❌ Disable service worker in production
❌ Use HTTP (requires HTTPS for PWA)
